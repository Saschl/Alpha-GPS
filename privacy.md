**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the Alpha GPS for Geotagging app ("Application") for mobile devices,
created by Saschl ("Service Provider") as an open‑source service. This service is provided "AS IS".

**What Data Is Collected and Why**

The Application is built with privacy by design. It **does not collect or sell any data for
advertising, tracking, or other commercial purposes**.

The Application only processes data that is strictly necessary for:

* Providing geotagging functionality for your Sony camera
* Diagnosing crashes and technical problems

In particular, the Application may process:

* Basic technical information about your device and app, such as:
    * Operating system version
    * App version in use
    * Device model
    * Time spent in the Application

* Diagnostic information for troubleshooting (via Sentry EU data centers), such as:
    * Logs and stack traces
    * Error messages and technical context at the time of a crash or failure

**Location Data**

The Application collects your device's location only to provide geotagging functionality:

* Location is used to transfer GPS coordinates to your connected Sony camera.
* Location data is **not** permanently stored by the Service Provider.
* Location data is **not** transmitted to any third party other than as part of anonymous crash logs
  where it is not needed and therefore not included.
* Location collection stops as soon as the connection to the camera is disconnected.

**Crash and Problem Analysis (Sentry)**

To keep the Application stable and to fix problems, anonymized diagnostic data may be sent to the
Sentry error reporting service, hosted in EU data centers.

* Data is used **only** to analyze crashes and technical problems.
* No personal data such as precise location history, device MAC addresses, or IP addresses is
  collected or stored for profiling.
* Data is **never** used for advertising, tracking, or sold to third parties.

You can opt out of this diagnostic collection at any time by disabling the troubleshooting/error
reporting feature in the Application settings.

For more details about Sentry’s handling of data, please see:

* [Sentry Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/)

The Application may also use:

* [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)

Please refer to their privacy policies for details about their processing.

**Opt-Out Rights**

You can stop all collection and processing of information by the Application at any time by:

* Disabling the troubleshooting/error reporting feature in the settings, and/or
* Uninstalling the Application using the standard process on your device or app store.

**Children**

The Application is not directed to children under the age of 13, and the Service Provider does not
knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you
believe that a child under 13 has provided personal information, please contact the Service Provider
so that it can be removed.

**Security**

The Service Provider takes the protection of your data seriously and implements reasonable technical
and organizational measures to safeguard the diagnostic information that is processed and
maintained.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be published on this page.
Continued use of the Application after changes are posted will be treated as acceptance of the
updated Privacy Policy.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-12-09.

**Your Consent**

By using the Application, you consent to the processing of your information as described in this
Privacy Policy, now and as amended from time to time.

**Contact Us**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or privacy while using the Application, please
contact the Service Provider at: **saschl.ra@web.de**.
